# My First React Project: Nike Shoe Showcase

This is my very first React project, a single-page application that showcases a stylish Nike shoe. The project was designed meticulously using Figma, and then I brought it to life using React.js and plain CSS

## Key Features

- Navbar: The project includes a navigation bar for easy access to different sections.
- Nike Shoe Showcase: The centerpiece of the project is a visually stunning Nike shoe, complete with a title and description to provide details about the product.

## Why I Built This

I decided to embark on this project to learn and practice React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By designing the project in Figma first, I honed my design skills and then applied them to create a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Plain CSS
- Figma (for design inspiration)
